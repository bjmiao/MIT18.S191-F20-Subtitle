1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,359
when it comes to computational thinking

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,519
it's always good to distinguish between

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:07,319
the theory and the practice at mit we

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:08,439
have the logo

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,519
men's a manus literally mind and hands

6
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:15,559
the mind refers to the theory the hand

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:16,600
refers to

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,839
the practice in the context of

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,440
computational thinking it's good to

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,320
think about

11
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:23,239
the algorithms the mathematics on the

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,879
one hand and how the software is used in

13
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:26,679
the real world

14
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,999
on the other hand and so with that in

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,839
mind because we've been talking about

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:31,959
convolutions

17
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,878
i thought i'd look into how convolutions

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,719
are being used in the real world

19
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,839
and so i took a look at uh some image

20
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,038
processing on

21
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:42,279
software like adobe premiere and i was

22
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:43,959
also wanted to show you

23
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,000
how it appears in software uh like

24
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,518
machine learning software

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,079
and in addition i kind of wanted to talk

26
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,439
a little bit about

27
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,719
the difference between building yourself

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,399
versus using a product building yourself

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,599
feels good you feel like you're in

30
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:01,878
control you know every piece of the

31
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:02,759
puzzle

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,238
but maybe no one person can always build

33
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,759
up the most complex software

34
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,599
on their own or maybe they don't want to

35
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,519
or have no time to

36
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:12,278
on the other hand when you use package

37
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:13,799
software of course you have the

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,918
professional

39
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:17,640
whistles and bells but you kind of often

40
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,079
lose a lot of control

41
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,359
and so that's something interesting to

42
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,558
think about in the context of

43
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,039
computational thinking

44
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,599
so this is adobe premiere this is video

45
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,359
editing software i'm not particularly

46
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,878
good at it but i started to dabble with

47
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:30,840
it a little bit

48
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,840
as long as i was making recordings i

49
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,200
thought it'd be kind of good to

50
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,039
see what i could do with it so i've got

51
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,719
my assistant here philip the corgi i've

52
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,319
got a picture of him right here

53
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,119
and i understood that convolutions were

54
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,399
effects that you could play with so i

55
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,918
thought i would try that out

56
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,119
and sure enough if i type convolution in

57
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:50,599
the effects menu i see all kinds of

58
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,840
convolutions that are preset

59
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,840
all kinds of kernels there's blur and

60
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,640
blur some more find edges gaussian blur

61
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,119
sharpen and so forth and so i thought i

62
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,238
would kind of

63
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:03,640
dabble a little bit more and i went

64
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,679
ahead and

65
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,079
added the find edges kernel and so here

66
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,558
i'll sort of show it to you

67
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,399
you can see that this little rectangle

68
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:12,679
here is

69
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:15,399
basically finding the edges and if you

70
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:16,280
look at this

71
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,200
if you sort of expand down close you

72
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,320
could see that

73
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,118
the 3x3 matrix listed right here it's

74
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:22,679
kind of

75
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:24,679
not really that convenient i guess to

76
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,200
play with the numbers but

77
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,520
here you could see a multiple of of one

78
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,240
two one

79
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,679
and minus one two one and so this is the

80
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:34,200
kernel that we've been playing in the x

81
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:34,840
direction

82
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,759
right so this is the this is the silvo

83
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,439
filter kernel that we've been learning

84
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,880
out in class

85
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,439
i happened to watch a video to learn how

86
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,319
to do this

87
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,240
and in the one video i watched the

88
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,520
gentleman pronounced

89
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:49,800
these nine numbers as m11 m12

90
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,960
m13 these are matrix elements and so

91
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,719
they'd normally be pronounced m11

92
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,360
m12 m13 i guess they would normally be

93
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,959
written with subscripts and maybe that

94
00:02:58,158 --> 00:02:59,160
would have made it more obvious

95
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,600
and of course you can play with these

96
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,520
numbers and you know get a lot of

97
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,280
different things happen you can go ahead

98
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:04,920
and

99
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,240
make this number much larger it would

100
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,000
wouldn't be so much of an edge detector

101
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,600
anymore

102
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,240
but uh if you would see would sort of

103
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,000
brighten that piece and so forth

104
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,280
so this is the sort of thing i guess you

105
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,039
could play with and what i'd like to

106
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:18,759
really say

107
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,360
maybe i'll just put it back at 15.

108
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,840
what i'd really like to say is one of

109
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,118
the things i realized is it's very

110
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:27,080
difficult to

111
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,160
find exactly what this is doing and this

112
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,520
is really my point that

113
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,959
it's kind of nice to go to this sort of

114
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:34,280
software and have all of these effects

115
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,719
like for example here's this gaussian

116
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:36,920
blur we can

117
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,439
start making this whole thing much more

118
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,880
blurry so we can start blurring

119
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,640
poor little phillies getting very blurry

120
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,480
now or we can go back and make them

121
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,080
sharp again

122
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,118
so nice user interface perhaps easy to

123
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:51,399
play with perhaps

124
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,480
you could get the nice list of all these

125
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,480
effects and see what's available to you

126
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,599
but it's not quite easy to know exactly

127
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,360
what's going on if you do things in your

128
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,319
own software

129
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,920
you have that benefit and so there's

130
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,878
that trade-off that i was talking about

131
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,080
here's one more picture i made with

132
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,160
adobe premiere just because it was fun

133
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,160
here is the lobby 7 building of

134
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,439
mit taken from killian court and i just

135
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,520
made this rectangle an edge detector and

136
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,199
also the lawn part over here

137
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,559
in edge detection just to see what it

138
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,319
would look like and i wanted to close

139
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,920
this segment with a few words about

140
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,278
machine learning so these days

141
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,439
you can i think everybody knows that you

142
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,600
can tell an apple from an orange

143
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,800
or an american football from a soccer

144
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,520
ball

145
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,999
or uh even a picture of me from a

146
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,680
picture of you these days

147
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,160
and you might wonder how that goes well

148
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,840
there's convolutions in there

149
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,840
and what happens is there are various

150
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,520
convolutions that will make a bigger

151
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:50,999
picture

152
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,559
smaller for example one way to do it is

153
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,360
if you

154
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,999
don't overlap the windows a three by

155
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,199
three window

156
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,800
you'll be divide the length and width by

157
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,319
three right and you can keep doing that

158
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,639
make smaller and smaller pictures

159
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:06,120
so the question is what numbers to put

160
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,639
in those convolutions

161
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,559
so with the sobo filter with these other

162
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,160
filters these are numbers that are

163
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,120
pre-decided

164
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,480
but in machine learning what we're going

165
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,439
to do is we're going to pick the numbers

166
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,278
such that somehow we could tell our

167
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:20,040
apples from our oranges or our meats

168
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,920
from you so

169
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,800
you're going to run some sort of

170
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,079
optimization that somehow is going to

171
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,360
separate

172
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,360
this image from that image you see and

173
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,360
so convolutions serve for image

174
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,559
processing where you don't even know

175
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,319
what the convolution is

176
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,400
you're going to actually do some sort of

177
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,600
optimization to figure it out as you go
