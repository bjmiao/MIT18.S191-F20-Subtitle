00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,438
hi i'm just reminiscing about one of my

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:04,599
early versions of image theme

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,759
written probably around six years ago

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,000
here you can see this data center this

5
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:09,880
is where the

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,680
mit computer science and ai lab building

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,399
lives

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,960
and in my family this building was

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,600
always called

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,640
the broken building because when my 20

11
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:21,480
year old son was just a little little

12
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:22,679
boy maybe he was

13
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:25,239
four years old the building was opening

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:25,879
and

15
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,159
he said dad this building looks broken

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,159
and so we always called it the broken

17
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,518
building

18
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,119
but what you see of course is that the

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,678
the building has so many nice edges and

20
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:40,518
so as you sort of let the lightning go

21
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,959
by you can see how it

22
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,640
kind of sometimes follows some of these

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,198
edges and that's a lot of fun

24
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,919
so regarding this problem set it was

25
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:51,640
inspired by a problem set over at brown

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,678
this is cs019 from 2014

27
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:57,079
where they basically kind of spell out

28
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,919
how students could implement this

29
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:01,079
algorithm and by now you've probably

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,998
heard that this algorithm

31
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:05,399
is was designed to be useful for being

32
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,439
able to resize

33
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,439
images for different modalities like

34
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,679
telephones or tv sets

35
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,759
so that you know projector screens so

36
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:13,879
that you can

37
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,238
not have to sort of distort with

38
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:16,918
different aspect ratios

39
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,959
so how did i first learn about this well

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,519
interestingly enough back in 2014 and i

41
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,799
just took up this email

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,558
so this email is from six years ago one

43
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,238
of my computer science colleagues

44
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:29,079
invited me to come down and they were

45
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,359
looking at different languages

46
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,519
python julia other languages for

47
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,918
introductory computer science classes

48
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:37,079
and probably at the time the clip julia

49
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,840
wasn't quite ready for an introductory

50
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,119
cs class

51
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,039
now of course julia's really been taking

52
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,159
off

53
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:45,159
so they didn't use julie at the time but

54
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,558
we had a lot of fun talking about

55
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,319
what we might do with you know with

56
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,840
julia in such a class

57
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,439
and one of the things that came up was

58
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,679
that python was really insufficient

59
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,518
for being able to do this imaging

60
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:58,679
algorithm they ended up using lots of

61
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,599
very very small images in fact

62
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,399
i put the images here that that was

63
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,679
being used in the class and you could

64
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:05,480
see these

65
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,880
very small images there's the bell

66
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,479
carving the bangalore dancers the

67
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,838
british museum

68
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,800
right and the chagall picture that these

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,240
pictures were

70
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,280
were tiny because if you make them small

71
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,679
then you wouldn't need so much time or

72
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:22,200
power to be able to

73
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,600
to do the image scene algorithm and even

74
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,118
back in the day i said that's silly just

75
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:26,840
use julia

76
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,719
it'll be perfectly fast so and you're

77
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,118
going to be the beneficiary of all of

78
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:37,318
that
