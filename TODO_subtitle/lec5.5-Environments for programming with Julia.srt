00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,040
hello today i'm going to talk to you

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,718
about different programming environments

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,240
you can code julia in

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,078
but first i'm going to start at kind of

5
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:09,160
a weird place the question

6
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,200
why is programming difficult to me

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,960
there are two reasons why programming is

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,319
hard first is

9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,839
writing the code itself understanding

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,079
the programming logic like how for loops

11
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:19,560
work

12
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,480
why exactly print line works the way it

13
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:23,640
does multiple dispatch all of this kind

14
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:24,440
of stuff

15
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,199
the other challenge which i think is

16
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:27,800
actually even more difficult at least

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,239
for beginning programmers

18
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,720
is running that code on your own machine

19
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,839
the reason i think this

20
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:34,198
is because when i started to learn to

21
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,518
code you know quite a few years ago

22
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,038
i found that i could genuinely

23
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,439
understand most of the programming logic

24
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,119
the textbook was trying to teach me

25
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,640
i understood loops i understood

26
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,399
conditionals i understood basically

27
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,079
everything that i needed to do i could

28
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,358
write the code

29
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:49,799
i just couldn't figure out how to get it

30
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,559
to run and i tried so many different

31
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,159
things and i could not figure it out

32
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,759
the textbook was trying to get me to use

33
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,079
some sort of ide that i genuinely didn't

34
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,599
understand

35
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,279
it wasn't until i opened up a terminal

36
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:01,959
and i learned that i could compile code

37
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:02,919
in that terminal

38
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:04,358
that i actually learned how to write

39
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:06,439
code properly and to me

40
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,000
being able to run code in that terminal

41
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,519
and being able to look at the file that

42
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:12,359
i'm typing and write it in my own text

43
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,799
editor was essential for me

44
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,840
understanding code

45
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,558
itself so this brings me to my main

46
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:18,278
point

47
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:19,879
different programming environments make

48
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,879
running code easier for different people

49
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,799
and different people gain intuition by

50
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,200
writing code in different ways so now we

51
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,480
want to talk a bit about what

52
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,480
programming environments are available

53
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,399
and to me there are three general

54
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,679
classes the first

55
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,840
is basic text editors the next are

56
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,599
integrated development environments or

57
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,079
ides which i alluded to earlier

58
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,039
and the last are notebooks now text

59
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,039
editors are usually the simplest to set

60
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:44,359
up

61
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,319
examples are vim nano notepad plus plus

62
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:47,878
basically

63
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:50,599
anything that you can write the code in

64
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,719
save it to file

65
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,198
and then run it separately links for

66
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,878
more information about all of these text

67
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:57,319
editors will be in the description but

68
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,679
essentially it doesn't really matter

69
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,518
what text editor you use you could

70
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:02,198
technically use microsoft word if you

71
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:02,918
wanted to

72
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:04,918
the point is you just write the code run

73
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:07,079
it separately now integrated development

74
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,799
environments have

75
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,160
loads of features it's essentially

76
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,000
combining the text editing step

77
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,920
with the running step now when i say it

78
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,920
has loads of features what i mean is

79
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,520
that integrated development environments

80
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,039
are usually what people use when they're

81
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,039
writing large software projects

82
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,960
so it has things like code completion

83
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,719
usually git integration so you can

84
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,000
version control your code

85
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,399
a bunch of other things for our purposes

86
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:29,240
we're going to be calling both vs code

87
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,679
and atom integrated development

88
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:32,360
environments for julia there used to be

89
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,039
another project called juno but i think

90
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,880
the juno developers are combining their

91
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,640
work into vs code soon

92
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,000
the point is that both of these could be

93
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,679
considered text editors with additional

94
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:41,800
features instead of

95
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,800
true integrated development environments

96
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,800
and trust me my twitch chat was really

97
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
really keen on pointing out the

98
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,039
difference between these

99
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,118
but i generally consider any environment

100
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:51,719
that combines both the editing step and

101
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,920
the running step into one

102
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,840
as an integrated development environment

103
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,200
and so we'll be showing these off in a

104
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:56,520
bit

105
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,640
finally the third programming

106
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,080
environment is also the one we've been

107
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,600
using the most for this class

108
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,360
and those are notebooks these are really

109
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
good for classes because they're

110
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,480
essentially markdown text with code in

111
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,840
built into it that you can run

112
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,200
which is really useful for a number of

113
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,880
different purposes and the notebooks

114
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,399
that most people use for julia

115
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:13,319
are pluto.jl which we've been using

116
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,759
again mostly for this class

117
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,520
and also jupiter at this point i think

118
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,880
it's worth showing an example

119
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,719
for all of these different editors so

120
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,080
first of all i'm going to be showing a

121
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,959
very simple vim

122
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:23,560
example what you're seeing here is me

123
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,319
writing a full script in vim

124
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,480
with twitch chat on the side i'm writing

125
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,840
an example that's available in the

126
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,520
algorithm archive for generating a

127
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,800
sierpinski triangle

128
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,080
as you can see here there's a bunch of

129
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,759
different plugins to vim that allow for

130
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,118
you to have syntax highlighting and a

131
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:37,240
bunch of other things

132
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,240
but this is generally the flow you write

133
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,920
code in one terminal you run it in

134
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,800
another terminal

135
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,399
like i said it's the easiest thing to

136
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,640
set up so it shouldn't be too difficult

137
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,160
to pick up as long as you can understand

138
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,840
the text editor that you're using

139
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,599
now vim is not necessarily the text

140
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,360
editor i would choose for beginners but

141
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,880
it's what i use and i like it a lot

142
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,239
so now i'm going to show you the general

143
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:56,920
workflow for visual studio

144
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,360
this is significantly different than

145
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,280
what we did with vim in that you can see

146
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,719
way more of the code what i'm showing

147
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,719
you now is the klima project the climate

148
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,520
machine project

149
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,200
that i do for work and i'm showing you

150
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,360
how you can kind of use some features

151
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,959
in visual studio to make it easier to

152
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:11,800
parse large code you can open up your

153
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,239
own terminal and run whatever code you

154
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:14,439
want in your terminal

155
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,879
if you want julia to work with visual

156
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,240
studio it's really important that you

157
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,840
get the right plugin specifically for

158
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,439
julia which i'm showing off here

159
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,120
now another point about visual studio is

160
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,559
that we will be having a short mini

161
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,319
lecture on how to use visual studio

162
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,759
specifically with julia

163
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,360
in the near future so keep that in mind

164
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,040
we'll be doing this again soon

165
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,639
and finally notebooks we've already

166
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,319
talked a lot about notebooks for this

167
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:33,800
course

168
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,400
so my assumption is that you already

169
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,240
know how to use them again please feel

170
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,840
free to check fonz's lecture if you want

171
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,040
more information there

172
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,360
so again bringing it all back together

173
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,879
different programming environments work

174
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,160
better for different people

175
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,999
and you as a programmer need to figure

176
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,840
out what environment works best for you

177
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,840
if it is genuinely a notebook then use a

178
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,240
notebook if you like ides use that

179
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,840
if you feel like you're best suited just

180
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,600
writing code in a terminal and compiling

181
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
it kind of like i am

182
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,559
then do that instead you just need to

183
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,838
make sure you're comfortable in whatever

184
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:02,120
you're coding in that's the most

185
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:07,319
important thing
