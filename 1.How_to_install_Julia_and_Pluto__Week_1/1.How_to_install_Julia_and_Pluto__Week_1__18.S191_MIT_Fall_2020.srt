1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,821
Right

2
00:00:00,821 --> 00:00:01,869
 My name is Fons

3
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:04,488
 And in this video I will show you how to install Julia

4
00:00:04,596 --> 00:00:05,609
 the programming language

5
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:07,692
 and Pluto, the programming environment

6
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,800
there's also a written version of this video available

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,441
 and there is also description

8
00:00:13,551 --> 00:00:14,861
 And if you have any questions

9
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:15,953
 you can email us

10
00:00:16,453 --> 00:00:19,117
so the first thing we do is to install Julia

11
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,587
so we go to JuliaLang.org

12
00:00:22,696 --> 00:00:26,416
and here it allows us to install

13
00:00:26,558 --> 00:00:29,467
to download Julia 1.5.1

14
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:31,761
which is the current stable release

15
00:00:31,872 --> 00:00:35,803
and so you find the platform that you have

16
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:37,331
in my case it's Windows

17
00:00:37,331 --> 00:00:40,171
You need click on the little help next to your OS

18
00:00:40,277 --> 00:00:43,338
so we click

19
00:00:43,338 --> 00:00:45,411
I already read this before

20
00:00:45,536 --> 00:00:48,468
 but it just tells us to download the installer, run it

21
00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:51,638
and we can also add it to our path

22
00:00:51,744 --> 00:00:55,067
You don't really need it for our course

23
00:00:56,813 --> 00:00:57,248
 but maybe you want it added later

24
00:00:57,389 --> 00:01:00,961
You can read this on your own if you like

25
00:01:01,076 --> 00:01:02,696
 So let's go to these downloads

26
00:01:02,816 --> 00:01:05,698
 and in my case I need the 64-bit installer

27
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,482
I save it

28
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:11,292
and while it is downloading

29
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,801
 maybe you can have a look around this website

30
00:01:13,923 --> 00:01:18,640
It has a bunch of resources to learn Julia

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,589
all right so downloaded and let's run

32
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:32,290
so take a minute to do install ... OK

33
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:37,205
 I'm just going to click next, etc.

34
00:01:37,205 --> 00:01:40,371
And I'll pause, and see you when it's done

35
00:01:40,589 --> 00:01:44,192
Okey, it's done and let's click finish

36
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,659
 And now whenever we want to start Julia

37
00:01:45,878 --> 00:01:48,172
You just go to the start menu

38
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:52,213
 and then it will be here, Julia 1.5.1

39
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:56,470
so now we end up in something called REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop)

40
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,202
and this is where it can accept commands

41
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,839
 you should try out

42
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:02,804
 can you do 1 plus 1, ..., 2, he works

43
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:06,298
So here you type your Julia commands

44
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:10,611
but to install Pluto,

45
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:14,652
Pluto is a Julia package because Pluto is written in Julia

46
00:02:14,774 --> 00:02:17,169
now we need to open a package manager

47
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,678
and in Julia the package manager is built into the REPL

48
00:02:19,678 --> 00:02:20,767
 So what you do is

49
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:23,280
you press that closing bracket ...

50
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:27,979
closing square bracket sign, ..., this sign

51
00:02:28,412 --> 00:02:32,671
and if you type that into the REPL without the hash at the start

52
00:02:32,998 --> 00:02:34,530
 you end up in the package manager

53
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,223
and this is where I can type package commands instead of Julia commands

54
00:02:39,554 --> 00:02:43,375
So this one doesn't work here it needs package commands

55
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:45,994
and the package commands we will give it was `add Pluto`

56
00:02:46,126 --> 00:02:48,617
and if you run it

57
00:02:48,617 --> 00:02:51,347
 it'll take a minute because we're doing this for the first time

58
00:02:51,457 --> 00:02:56,041
 and it's setting up the package environments on the registry et cetera

59
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,991
so I'll pause again and I'll see you when it's done

60
00:02:58,991 --> 00:02:59,973
So it's done

61
00:02:59,973 --> 00:03:04,235
and now I'm going to press Backspace and back into the Julia REPL

62
00:03:04,235 --> 00:03:07,943
Back into Julia REPL I will type 'import Pluto'

63
00:03:07,943 --> 00:03:09,146
press enter

64
00:03:09,265 --> 00:03:11,551
then it says

65
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:14,061
to start a notebook server you do `Pluto.run()`

66
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:16,684
let's give it a minute to load

67
00:03:16,684 --> 00:03:19,846
Pluto.run()

68
00:03:21,376 --> 00:03:27,599
and now it's telling us to go to localhost:1234 in your browser

69
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:31,859
so if you press Ctrl+C in the terminal

70
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,044
that's how you stop Pluto

71
00:03:34,196 --> 00:03:37,211
so don't copy this using Ctrl+C

72
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,049
 it's different in the terminal for some reason

73
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,672
OK so in the browser (you need Firefox or Chrome btw)

74
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,497
you go to localhost:1234

75
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,914
You see I have typed it already

76
00:03:47,914 --> 00:03:53,155
And you go there, it's loading and says welcome to Pluto

77
00:03:53,372 --> 00:03:55,011
and so if you've seen this for the first time

78
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,539
 which you probably are

79
00:03:56,649 --> 00:03:59,270
then you might want to have a look at these sample notebooks

80
00:03:59,378 --> 00:04:00,472
Take click here

81
00:04:00,472 --> 00:04:03,311
and these are meant to introduce you to Pluto

82
00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:08,225
but also a bit to mathematics and to Julia code

83
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:10,736
if you're new to Julia

84
00:04:10,886 --> 00:04:13,904
 I recommend having looked at 1,2 and 6

85
00:04:14,027 --> 00:04:17,724
Because they explain... they also teach you a bit of Julia

86
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:21,332
Right, so in our case

87
00:04:21,472 --> 00:04:24,493
 we want to work on homework 0

88
00:04:24,606 --> 00:04:27,444
so we go to the github for the course page

89
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:30,504
and then we go to homework 0

90
00:04:30,623 --> 00:04:34,759
and so this, the hw0.jl

91
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:37,709
is the link to the notebook file

92
00:04:37,817 --> 00:04:41,311
 So you take this link, copy

93
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,606
and then here you Paste

94
00:04:43,713 --> 00:04:45,352
press open

95
00:04:47,102 --> 00:04:50,151
are you sure and you say Yes, I'm sure

96
00:04:52,338 --> 00:04:56,820
and what it will do in this homework 0 is based on a template notebook

97
00:04:56,955 --> 00:04:58,997
 and you have to start out from the template notebook

98
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:02,165
 adding your own stuff and then sending a book back to us

99
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:03,151
and so right now

100
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:04,895
 it's starting Pluto for the first time

101
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,186
 which is why it takes a while

102
00:05:07,186 --> 00:05:09,110
And it just downloaded the notebook

103
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:10,532
 the template notebook

104
00:05:10,748 --> 00:05:13,915
and it's running it

105
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:15,774
so the first thing one to do before anything else

106
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:17,191
is to save this notebook

107
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,575
 So right now it isn't saved anywhere

108
00:05:20,575 --> 00:05:22,978
so let's first create a folder

109
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:24,837
 And this is different on every OS

110
00:05:24,837 --> 00:05:26,910
 but I'm on windows so

111
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,111
go to file explorer

112
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,406
 let's say Documents

113
00:05:30,406 --> 00:05:38,266
New folder, 18S191 SUBMISSIONS

114
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:45,257
what we need now is the path to this folder

115
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:47,660
so go inside the folder which is empty

116
00:05:49,188 --> 00:05:52,681
 and then I do right click, Properties

117
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:56,066
and this tells me where this folder is exactly

118
00:05:56,175 --> 00:05:59,209
So this is where you want to save this notebook

119
00:05:59,332 --> 00:06:00,409
 So you go here

120
00:06:00,518 --> 00:06:03,243
 And this is where you type the file

121
00:06:04,327 --> 00:06:06,624
 so I paste, this

122
00:06:06,837 --> 00:06:09,895
 and then it was 18...SUBMISSIONS...(Using tab to auto-complete)

123
00:06:10,113 --> 00:06:12,844
that's called this homework 0

124
00:06:13,502 --> 00:06:14,917
my name is Fonsi

125
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:17,320
Here you go

126
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:21,366
and so next you just work on a notebook

127
00:06:21,493 --> 00:06:23,437
The instructions are inside the notebook

128
00:06:23,986 --> 00:06:24,964
when you're done

129
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,604
this is where the file is

130
00:06:26,825 --> 00:06:29,552
and you can see it in the folder

131
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:32,499
and so to submit it to canvas

132
00:06:33,813 --> 00:06:34,792
you go to canvas

133
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:36,056
 and then there's an assignment

134
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,693
called homework 0

135
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:44,155
you click, and then here to submit the file

136
00:06:44,374 --> 00:06:51,449
 the file upload is this Julia file

137
00:06:52,105 --> 00:06:53,304
there you go

138
00:06:53,522 --> 00:06:54,509
 have fun

139
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,939
 and let's see you soon
