1
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:06,816
[Music]

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,443
so as long as here we are in the

3
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:15,160
computer science and AI laboratory

4
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:17,019
let me ask perhaps by a show of hands

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,040
from the audience how many of you know
what a programming language is

6
00:00:22,104 --> 00:00:25,369
okay this is MIT after all
so maybe I shouldn't be surprised

7
00:00:25,394 --> 00:00:29,260
how many of you have
programmed the computer again

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,760
I know this is this is a
great audience this

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,226
this is MIT

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,329
so I'm a co-founder
co-inventor of a programming language

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,128
known as Julia perhaps some of you have

12
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:42,729
used it and this language is becoming

13
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:44,439
increasingly popular for all of the

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,959
various kinds of models that will be

15
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,849
coming up in the various talks today the

16
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,158
climate models the economic models the

17
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,279
various political models and so forth so

18
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,104
let me say a little bit about myself

19
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:58,538
first of all I'm a mathematician I'm a

20
00:00:58,563 --> 00:01:00,641
computer scientist here in this building

21
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,588
I mentioned that I'm a co-inventor of

22
00:01:02,634 --> 00:01:05,269
the programming language Julia

23
00:01:05,294 --> 00:01:08,008
I have a wife and two children and
the cutest little Corgi on the planet

24
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:09,995
so you might see him around here

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,890
what I'm not, to be
honest, I'm not a climate scientist

26
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,944
I'm not an economist I'm not a policy maker

27
00:01:18,238 --> 00:01:20,665
I'm not even completely
sure why I'm even in this room

28
00:01:20,865 --> 00:01:24,174
except we are all on
this planet together

29
00:01:24,216 --> 00:01:27,079
so about programming
languages

30
00:01:27,205 --> 00:01:32,294
humans talk to computers specifying the
instructions that automate our world

31
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,005
with programming language

32
00:01:34,205 --> 00:01:35,729
the climate models the economic models

33
00:01:35,754 --> 00:01:40,296
the political models are they're all
implemented as instructions to computers

34
00:01:41,204 --> 00:01:43,356
I co-founded this
programming language

35
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:45,239
Julia that allows not only

36
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,039
humans to talk to computers but

37
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,950
it allows humans to talk to humans about

38
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:53,169
their intent on the computer

39
00:01:53,194 --> 00:01:55,750
so we all have this vision of we program a

40
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,349
computer maybe you sit in your own
little room and a little silo somewhere

41
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,080
and you specify these arcane instructions
that you tell the computer what to do

42
00:02:04,105 --> 00:02:06,399
I have a vision of the

43
00:02:06,424 --> 00:02:09,850
ability to have other humans know what

44
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:12,914
it is you're telling
the computer and what they can do

45
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:15,550
you might think that
it's a common occurrence that

46
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,250
programming languages can, you know,

47
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:22,059
somebody writes a program and a person can look at
it and see what's going on

48
00:02:22,084 --> 00:02:24,264
but I assure you it's anything but

49
00:02:24,652 --> 00:02:28,930
I've taken a look at some climate models
some of the codes out there

50
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:31,372
and I assure you it is very very
very difficult

51
00:02:31,397 --> 00:02:35,943
for a human to find out what is going on
in those models

52
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:39,170
perhaps you've programmed

53
00:02:39,195 --> 00:02:40,749
many of you have raised your hand

54
00:02:40,863 --> 00:02:43,153
there are languages out there there's
that

55
00:02:43,178 --> 00:02:46,654
some of you may have
heard of like Java and C++

56
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:50,402
these are languages that are very very
common in the business world

57
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:53,580
there are other languages that
are easy to use

58
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,890
they're scratch, Python was invented as a

59
00:02:55,915 --> 00:02:57,745
language to become easy to use and

60
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,423
because it was so easy to use it became

61
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:03,765
extremely popular and
now it's very very widely used

62
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,740
so the common wisdom has
always been for programming languages is

63
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:10,597
that there is you could
have an either or nor,

64
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:14,811
either you can have a
programming language that's easy to program

65
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:16,479
but you'll pay the price

66
00:03:16,504 --> 00:03:18,180
somehow the programs will
execute much more slowly

67
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:20,365
you will lose out on performance

68
00:03:20,693 --> 00:03:23,698
the other possibility is you

69
00:03:23,731 --> 00:03:25,609
it's a much more
difficult endeavor

70
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:29,386
you have to be much more skilled at programming but then
you can get the performance

71
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:34,140
we set out to show that it wasn't one or
the other

72
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:35,561
you can have your cake and eat it too

73
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:37,285
the Julia programming language lets you

74
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,450
program readily but
also gets you performance

75
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,815
if you look at the climate

76
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,439
models you find some of the time that

77
00:03:43,464 --> 00:03:45,169
the codes are unavailable a lot of the

78
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:48,060
time scientists write a paper they put

79
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:50,035
together some powerpoints they might put

80
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,870
together some output of their code but

81
00:03:51,895 --> 00:03:54,731
the code itself is
unavailable for you to look at

82
00:03:54,931 --> 00:03:57,262
okay this is what we call closed source

83
00:03:57,754 --> 00:03:59,333
other times

84
00:03:59,358 --> 00:04:04,816
the codes are available you can look at them
but they're not easy to look at

85
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:07,285
but very often what
people are doing is

86
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,081
what's called low-level
programming

87
00:04:09,106 --> 00:04:12,645
you specify very specifically
what you want the computer to do

88
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,176
perhaps you get performance by doing that

89
00:04:15,201 --> 00:04:19,971
but you lose complete sight of what
it is from a high level that's going on

90
00:04:20,324 --> 00:04:23,840
what continues to
surprise me as a Julia co-founder

91
00:04:24,642 --> 00:04:28,275
is that a programming language can let
humans talk to humans

92
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:30,794
a programming language
can create community

93
00:04:30,986 --> 00:04:34,053
a programming language
can actually create social action

94
00:04:34,078 --> 00:04:36,848
it opens very very human possibilities

95
00:04:37,288 --> 00:04:38,410
so my own story is a
testament to the power of language so I

96
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:44,970
have a confession to make I'm gonna make it publicly

97
00:04:44,995 --> 00:04:46,860
a year ago I wasn't thinking about

98
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:48,653
anything climate at all sure I read the

99
00:04:48,678 --> 00:04:53,258
papers I knew that the earth was warming
and it was bad

100
00:04:53,283 --> 00:04:55,810
but I kind of lumped it with all the
other bad news in the papers and I

101
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:57,586
didn't particularly relate to it okay

102
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,699
but now I put solar panels on the roof

103
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:02,969
we installed the electric vehicle plugs

104
00:05:02,994 --> 00:05:05,551
and maybe most important of all

105
00:05:05,644 --> 00:05:09,456
I feel guilty I feel
personally connected to the problem

106
00:05:09,481 --> 00:05:12,479
even when I see my little
friend here with his fur coat

107
00:05:12,682 --> 00:05:16,166
who hates going out in the
summer because of his fur coat

108
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:19,429
and loves to have to frolic in the snow

109
00:05:19,454 --> 00:05:21,112
I almost feel the message that

110
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:23,609
we can't afford to be
messing with the planet

111
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:26,664
I just I see
these messages everywhere I go

112
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,775
a year ago the ocean modelers at MIT

113
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,319
came to my office upstairs and

114
00:05:32,344 --> 00:05:34,015
told me about the climber
project

115
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,550
and their goal was to rebuild a
state-of-the-art model

116
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,127
of the earth the climate

117
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,082
what they told me is that
what they wanted to do was

118
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:44,949
was write the entire code in Julia

119
00:05:44,974 --> 00:05:46,785
they told me not to
talk them out of it okay

120
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,373
and they're doing this because

121
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:51,228
the old codes were just
not working for them

122
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,875
so when it comes
to language let me point out

123
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,045
that philosophers and mathematicians have
been talking about the importance of language

124
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,249
for many many years

125
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:03,648
people have known for a
long time that

126
00:06:03,842 --> 00:06:06,338
language influences us
the words

127
00:06:06,363 --> 00:06:08,934
that we have available
changes what we can do

128
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,528
mathematicians like Poincare

129
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:14,561
have known for a long
time that your choice of notation

130
00:06:14,823 --> 00:06:16,294
can enable new discoveries or

131
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,072
constrain new discoveries

132
00:06:20,097 --> 00:06:23,645
and so I'm here to talk about the
computer science version of all this and

133
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,778
a good programming language design

134
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:28,689
is really
applied psychology

135
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,664
now again if you think
of a programming language

136
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:33,189
as just a means of

137
00:06:33,214 --> 00:06:36,940
specifying instructions
that only a machine can understand

138
00:06:37,378 --> 00:06:39,189
then you're not seeing the

139
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:41,658
real value of modern programming language

140
00:06:41,683 --> 00:06:43,563
modern programming language can now

141
00:06:43,588 --> 00:06:46,179
be a kind of Applied
Psychology

142
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:48,129
it can allow us to create
communities of people

143
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:50,318
who can work together to solve problems

144
00:06:50,518 --> 00:06:52,036
it can allow us to talk to humans

145
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:56,679
as well as machines when we want to specify
what it is that a climate model

146
00:06:56,704 --> 00:06:59,667
or an economic model
or a political model is doing

147
00:06:59,692 --> 00:07:02,674
it enables all kinds of
collaboration of programs

148
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,345
if you have a
good programming model

149
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:11,206
and of course for all the complexities of the various
kinds of models that we're doing for the earth

150
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,798
everybody these days
wants to do high-performance

151
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:17,184
high performance
computing used to be a very small subject

152
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:21,270
and now it's the sort of thing
that everybody wants to do

153
00:07:22,028 --> 00:07:25,476
so scientists communicate
with math symbols

154
00:07:25,785 --> 00:07:29,543
here I'm showing on the
top the kinds of mathematical symbols

155
00:07:29,568 --> 00:07:33,598
that a climate modeler might
put in one of his or her papers right

156
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:36,235
so it doesn't matter
what the model is saying

157
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,859
the point is that
people communicate with these symbols

158
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:42,161
people understand what they're doing
with these symbols okay

159
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:45,556
but what does a scientist code
typically

160
00:07:45,627 --> 00:07:48,278
well you see it right there below
the symbols you see

161
00:07:48,373 --> 00:07:51,193
a lot more lines of very
very specific instructions

162
00:07:51,368 --> 00:07:53,062
and I hope you can see my point

163
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,519
that it's not very easy
to relate back to

164
00:07:56,544 --> 00:08:01,306
the symbols if you understand these
symbols the code really really doesn't help

165
00:08:01,505 --> 00:08:04,101
so the code is really not the math is it

166
00:08:04,126 --> 00:08:05,581
but with julia we

167
00:08:05,606 --> 00:08:08,449
tell people you don't
code the math code is the math

168
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,903
and so at the highest level

169
00:08:10,025 --> 00:08:14,865
if these are the equations that are going
to tell you how the climate is changing

170
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,594
you want at this level to be able to

171
00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:18,664
just specify these sorts of symbols

172
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:20,468
right and this code actually runs and

173
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:23,010
implements this model

174
00:08:23,354 --> 00:08:25,653
and we're doing the kind
of research that makes it possible

175
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:28,267
to
implement this sort of thing

176
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:29,649
you could do it on
your desktop

177
00:08:29,848 --> 00:08:31,509
you could do it on a
supercomputer

178
00:08:31,534 --> 00:08:33,875
you could do it on the GPUs
that are running very fast and

179
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,823
we've even played a little bit of

180
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:39,465
with the TPUs, the Google
tensor processing units

181
00:08:39,888 --> 00:08:41,588
my final point and

182
00:08:41,613 --> 00:08:43,308
my most important point is

183
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,439
what is known as composability

184
00:08:46,464 --> 00:08:50,047
so programming when you program
a you write a program for yourself

185
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,622
and somebody else writes another program

186
00:08:52,647 --> 00:08:55,445
you might think that
they would work together very well

187
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,500
but they never do

188
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,256
how many of you have ever had a problem

189
00:08:58,281 --> 00:09:00,295
with a computer not
doing what you wanted it to do

190
00:09:00,838 --> 00:09:02,649
okay that's probably everybody

191
00:09:02,804 --> 00:09:04,827
right so computers are like that

192
00:09:04,897 --> 00:09:06,305
if you write a program and then

193
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,049
somebody else writes a program

194
00:09:08,074 --> 00:09:09,370
with no particular intent for

195
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,039
them working together
they usually don't

196
00:09:12,064 --> 00:09:13,914
because people are able
to write programs

197
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:17,283
at a very high level we find that they

198
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:19,269
compose the technical
word is composing

199
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:22,237
which means that these
programs can run together

200
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:25,614
and so to give you an
example of this composability

201
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,135
we have this
complex interconnected planet you know

202
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,736
we need to work together
in much much better ways

203
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:34,492
we have the folks with the CliMA project
which I'm showing there on the upper left

204
00:09:34,693 --> 00:09:39,909
we have economists who are working together
to combined with people who do risk modeling

205
00:09:40,074 --> 00:09:41,585
there the environmentalists
who are tracking the

206
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,072
motions of the animals
on the planets energy trading

207
00:09:45,272 --> 00:09:47,766
we talk about how
everybody can play a role

208
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:51,101
but what we really would like to see
is everybody playing this role together

209
00:09:51,302 --> 00:09:52,714
so no more of this

210
00:09:52,854 --> 00:09:54,185
you sit in your office you write

211
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,136
your program and you talk about it

212
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:58,709
somebody else writes a program and they
talk about it

213
00:09:58,734 --> 00:10:02,532
we're trying to talk about a whole system
where everybody can work together

214
00:10:02,557 --> 00:10:06,818
so the climate modeler the economists
a person who's doing an insurance model

215
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:08,699
might want to put all of this together

216
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:10,381
and see how this can work

217
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:14,171
let me conclude by saying that

218
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,920
what I've learned both
personally and professionally is that

219
00:10:16,945 --> 00:10:21,346
everybody can play a role in
helping to solve the problem of the climate

220
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,919
what I'd like to ask is
through personal action

221
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,899
collective action and participating

222
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,269
together including through software we

223
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,919
should all work together to solve the

224
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,379
problem of healing the planet thank you

225
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,580
[Applause]
